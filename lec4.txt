Langchain is a open source framework to create application using LLm

Components of Langchain
-> Models
-> Prompts
-> Chains
-> Memory
-> Indexes
-> Agents

Models:
-> In Langchain Models are the core interfaces through which we interact with AI models 

-> 2 types of models
    -> language models
    -> embedding models 

Prompts:
-> Instructions sent to the language models

chains:
-> We can build pipelines using this 

Indexes:
-> Indexes connects application to external knowledge source
-> types of Indexes:
    -> doc loader
    -> text splitter
    -> vector store
    -> retrivers

Memory:
-> LLM api calls are stateless
Types of Memories: 
    -> Conversation Buffer Memory : stores transcripts of recent messages
    -> Conversation Buffer Window Memory: Only keeps last N interactions to avoid excessive token usage
    -> Summarizer based Memory: Periodically Summarizes older chats
    -> Custom Memory: User preferred Memory storage


Agents:
-> Use language models to solve real life problems
