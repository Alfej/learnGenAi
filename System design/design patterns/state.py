# State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.
# Applicability:
# Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently
# Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
#  Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine
