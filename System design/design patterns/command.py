# Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

# Applicability:
# Use the Command pattern when you want to parametrize objects with operations.
# Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
# Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations
