# Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.
# The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

# example:
#     The Factory Method pattern is widely used in Python code. Itâ€™s very useful when you need to provide a high level of flexibility for your code.
