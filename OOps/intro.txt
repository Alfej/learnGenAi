Why OOPs was required?
-> We were able to right code according to real world problem, Not as technical level like machine code or assembly code 
    -> Real world consist of a objects and they interact with eachothers
    -> Real world objects have charechteristics and behaviours
-> It provide data security
-> Provides code reusability/ Scalability

Pillars of OOPS:
1. Abstraction
    -> Interface 
    -> Hides Unnecessary details from client and shows only what is necessary

2. Encaptulation
    -> data and method is combined together
    -> Make sure only required methods or objects are open for client.
