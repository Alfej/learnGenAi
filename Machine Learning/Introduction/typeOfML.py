# Based on amount of supervision needed
    # Supervised Learning : Base on labeled data (Data with input and output) we find out mathematical relationship between input and output. and help us to predict output for new input.
        # Classification : if output is discrete value (Categorical data) then it is called classification.
            # Binary Classification : if output is only two values (0 or 1) then it is called binary classification.
            # Multi-class Classification : if output is more than two values then it is called multi-class classification.
            # Multi-label Classification : if output can have multiple values then it is called multi-label classification. 
        # Regression : if output is continuous numeric value then it is called regression. 
        
    # Unsupervised Learning : Based on unlabeled data (Data with only input) we find out patterns in the data.
        # Clustering : grouping similar data points together.
            # Hierarchical Clustering : creating a hierarchy of clusters.
            # K-means Clustering : partitioning data into K distinct clusters.
        # Dimensionality Reduction : reducing the number of features in the data while preserving important information.
            # Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : transforming data to a lower-dimensional space.
            # t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) : visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.
        # Anomaly Detection : identifying rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
        # Association Rule Learning : discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
    
    # Reinforcement Learning : learning by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward signal.
        # Markov Decision Processes (MDP) : modeling decision-making situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.
        # Q-Learning : a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state.
        # Deep Reinforcement Learning : combining deep learning with reinforcement learning principles to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
    
    # semi-supervised Learning : a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where a small amount of labeled data is used along with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.
