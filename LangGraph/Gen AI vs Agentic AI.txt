Gen AI:
-> IR resembles class of AI models that can create new content such as text, images, audios, code or videos that resembles human created data 


Agentic AI:
-> Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take up the task or goal from a user and then completing it on its own with minimal human guidance 
-> 6 characteristics of Agentic AI:
    -> Autonomus :
        - It refers to the AI systems ability to make decisions and take actions on its own to achive the given goal without needing human instruction
        - Autonomy in multiple facet
            -> Execution 
            -> Decision Making
            -> Tool use 
        - Autonomy can be controlled
            -> Permission Scop
            -> Human In the loop
            -> Override controls
            -> guard rails/ policies 

    -> Goal Oriented
        - Being Goal oriented means that AI system operates with persistent objective in mind and continuosly directs the actions to achive the objectives, rather than just responding to isolated prompts 

    -> Planning:
        - Planning in the agent's ability to break down a high level job into a sequence of actions or subgoals and decide the best path to achive the desired outcome 
    -> Reasoning 
        - Reasoning is cognetive process through which an Agentic AI system interprets information, draws conclusion and makes decisions both while planning and executing actions in realtime 

    -> Adaptability
        - Adaptabillity is Agents ability to modify its plan, strategies or response to unexpected conditions- All while staying aligned with goal 
    -> Context Awareness
        - Context Awareness is Agent's ability to understand, retain and utilize relevant information from the ongoing task, past interaction, user preference, and environmental cues to make better decision throughout a multistep process 


-> Components of Agentic AI:
    -> Brain -> LLM (works: Goal interpretation, planning, reasoning, tool selection, communication)
    -> Orchestrator -> (Works: Task sequencing, conditional routing, retry logic, looping & interaction, delegation)
    -> tools -> (Works: Extrnel access, knowledgebase access)
    -> Memory -> (Works: short term memory, Long term Memory, sate tracking)
    -> Supervisor -> (Works: Approval request, Duardrails Enforcement, Edge case handling)
