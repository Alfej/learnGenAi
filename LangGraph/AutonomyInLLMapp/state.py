What is State in LangGraph?
State in LangGraph is a way to maintain and track information as an AI system processes data.

Think of it as the system's memory, allowing it to remember and update information as it moves through different stages of a workflow, or graph.

Declarative Annotated State Transformation (DAS) is a key concept in LangGraph, where the state is defined declaratively and can be transformed through various operations.
