Level of Autonomy:
-> Code ->0 autonomy & 100% deterministic
    -> Everything is Hard coded and not even really cognitive architecture 
    -> dis Ad.:-> Need to write rules for each possible scenario

-> LLM call:
    -> give app input it prcesses and give backs output
    -> translator app as example
    -> dis ad.:-> Try to get everything done in oneshot often leads to confusion or mixed up response 

-> Chains:
    -> Instead of one generalist multiple Specialist.
    -> Instead os asking One AI to do everything, We break down the syteps where each AI is good at one thing
    -> dis ad.:-> Fixed sequences are like rigid assembly line (Always follows the same sequence)

-> Routers:
    -> Instead of having fixed paths like chaiins, AI it self decides what steps to take next
    -> dis ad.:-> While it can choose different path, It can't remember the previous conversation or learn from mistakes.

-> Agent:
    -> This is combining the previous level but with loops 
    -> Agent = Control flow cotrolled by an LLM
    
    -> Advantages:
        -> Human in the loop asks for approval 
        -> Multiagent system
        -> Memory management 
        -> Go to history and explore better alternate path
        -> Adaptive learning
