Tool Binding:
-> It is the step where we register tools with LLMs so that:
    -> LLM can know what tools are available 
    -> It knows what each tool does 
    -> It knows what input format to use

Tool calling:
-> It is the process where LLM decides during the converstion or task, that it needs to use specific tool and generates and generates the structured output with:
    -> The name of the tool 
    -> the argument to call with 

    -> The LLM does not actually run the tool - it suggests the tool and arguments. The actual execution is handled by langchain or us
    
Tool execution:
-> Tool execution is the step where the actual python function is run using the input arguments that the LLM suggested during tool calling
