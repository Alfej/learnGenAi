Structured output -> model response in structured format 
Used in-> Data extraction, API bulding, Agents

2 ways to get the structured output:
    -> LLm can generate structured output -> with_structured_output()
    -> LLm can't generate structured output -> output parser classes 

1. with_structured_output():
-> have to call before invoking model 
-> have to define the structure output
    -> provide the structure in 3 ways 
        -> typedict
        -> pydantic
        -> json

typedict = define the dictionary with specified keys should exist
pydentic = it is data parsing and validation library in python, it ensures the data we are working with is structures and correct
 -> pydentic is strart enough to perform coercing if its getting a value in a different format
 -> have builtin validations for thr define types
 -> have a field function that can be used to apply a constrains 

 2. output parser:
 helps raw output to be converted in the structured output like json, csv, pydentic and any more
 -> string output parser
 -> json output parser -> can just force LLm to return json object but can't enforce schema
 -> structured output parser -> can enfprce the schema but data validation is not possible 
 -> pydentic output parser
