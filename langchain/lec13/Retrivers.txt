                     -> Archive based 

-> search stratagy based -> MMR (Maximum marginal relevance) -> How to pick a result that are not only similar but also different to each other 
                         -> Multi query -> Sometime single query not captures all the ways information is phrased in document -> generate further question to remove embiguity 
                         -> Cntextual compression -> Improves retrivel quality by compressing documents after retrivel
