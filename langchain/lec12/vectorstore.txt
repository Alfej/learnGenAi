Challenges faced with the recomander system 
-> Embedding Generation
-> storage of generated vectors
-> Inteliggent sementic search within this vectors

-> Vector store solves this problems 


-> Vector store is the system designed to store and retrive data presented in vector forms

->Key features:
    -> Storage -> in memory or On disk -> store vector with metadata information
    -> similarity search -> HELPS to retrive most similar vector
    -> indexing -> Provide data structure to enable faster similarity search 
    -> CRUD operation


Vector store vs Vector Database:
-> Store -> system where you store and retrive the records we can say is store 
-> Store feature + database like features 

-> Example of store -> FAISS

Vector database Examples: Milvus, Qdrant, weaviate, pinecone
