What is AI Agent?
-> It is an intelligent system that receives a high leve; goal from user and autonomously plan, decides, and executes a sequence of actions by using external tools, API, or knowledge source - All while maintaining context, reasoning over multiple steps, adapting to new information and optimizing for the intended outcome

Charecteristics of AI Agent:
-> Goal - driven: Jut tell agent what to do, Not how to do 
-> Autonomous planning: Agent Break downs the problem and sequences task on its own 
-> Tool using: automatically calls tools
-> Context Aware: Maintains memory accross steps to inform future actions 
-> Adaptive: Rethinks plan when things changes 

ReAct pattern:
-> It is design pattern used in AI Agents 
-> It stands for Reasoning and actions
-> It allows a Language model to interleave internal thoughts with external actions in structured multi-step process
-> Instead of generating answers in one go, the model thinks in step by step manner deciding what needs to do next and optionally calling tool to help it

ReAct is Useful for:
-> Multistep problem 
-> Tool augumented task
-> Making the agents reasoning transparent and auditable
